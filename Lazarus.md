**Lazarus Group**  
Lazarus Group was first identified as active in 2009, as a North Korean state-sponsored cyber threat group. They are highly likely to be associated with The Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB), North Korea's primary foreign intelligence agency; it is composed of six sub-bureaus to include "technology and cyber capabilities". Bureau 121 is the North Korean cyber warfare agency and is to be considered the main unit of the RGB and conducts multiple types of offensive cyber operations to include espionage and finance based crimes. 

**Recruitment:**  
	North Korea is an isolated nation state that utilizes a caste system to determine a citizen's worth to the government. The North Koreans refer to this as *Songbun* and it has three levels. The Hostile Class is the lowest rank class within Songbun, they are under constant supervision and are subjected to high levels of discrimination and mistreatment. The Hostiles have very little if any access to even North Korean luxury items. This makes them a credible threat to the government as resentment forms, and there will be an increased desire for escape. The Wavering Class is considered to be the “middle class” of North Korea, they are considered to provide economic value to the country and are subjected to a consistent form of indoctrination. The Wavering class is allowed to enjoy some forms of North Korean luxuries and movement capabilities within the borders of North Korea. The Core Class is considered to be the highest level which one can reach in the caste system, and within the core class there are sub-rankings that members fall into, at the top of the Core Class is where the Kim family resides.   
	Given that North Korea is a police state, they monitor their citizens from birth; to include their education. Children are tested from birth and if they show aptitude for anything deemed high value by the regime, they are trained at a high level for the rest of their life. This includes citizens that show an aptitude for computer science and/or mathematics. Lazarus Group members are hand selected by the Bureau’s leadership and are separated from their peers to foster their skill set. The potential future members are found within the Hostile and Wavering Classes respectively. Once recruited and trained these members move up to the Core Class and receive state luxuries, including the ability to travel outside of North Korea if deemed necessary. With their new found class and years of indoctrination, they are less likely to abandon or betray their country. 

**Organizational Structure:**  
	Lazarus is referred to a “Group” unlike other Advanced Persistent Threats because it is comprised of several APTs to include the following:

* Andariel  
  * They primarily focused on destructive attacks that are aimed at discrediting the South Korean Government, their domestic companies, and financial operations.  
* APT37  
  *   
* APT38  
* Kimsuky
